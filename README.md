## Features

- **Procedural Fantasy Events**: Generate events in diverse categories like political, magical, social, economic, conflict, mystery, and more
- **Dynamic World State**: World state evolves with each event, including seasons, weather, character relationships, and faction dynamics
- **AI-Enhanced Storytelling**: Integration with Google's Gemini AI to add rich details, consequences,  plot hooks, connections between events
- **Event Images**: Generate fantasy illustrations for events (requires Google Gemini API key)
- **Telegram Integration**: Broadcast events (with images) to Telegram chats with special admin-only details
- **Persistent Worlds**: Save and reload your fantasy worlds with persistent state
- **SQLite Database**: All world data, events, and relationships are stored in SQLite databases, making it easy to access and reuse the data in other projects

## Data Persistence

The Fantasy World Generator uses SQLite to store all world information, including:

- Generated events with full details and relationships
- Character information and their evolving relationships
- Faction dynamics and territorial changes
- Historical event chains and consequences
- World state including weather, seasons, and political climate

This database approach allows you to:
- Access your fantasy world data from external applications
- Create custom analytics or visualization tools
- Develop complementary applications that build on your world's history
- Export data for use in other game systems or storytelling platforms

## Telegram Integration

The Fantasy World Generator includes full Telegram bot integration that allows you to:

- Receive event notifications directly to your Telegram account
- View images associated with events
- Access hidden GM/DM information through interactive buttons
- Explore connections to previous events
- Discover adventure hooks and possible consequences

### Telegram Button Functionality

Each event sent to Telegram includes interactive buttons that provide additional GM/DM information:

- üîç **Behind the Scenes**: Hidden details about the event
- üîó **Connections**: How this event relates to previous events
- ‚öîÔ∏è **Adventure Hooks**: Potential adventure hooks related to this event
- üîÆ **Consequences**: Possible outcomes of this event

Each event maintains its own private data, ensuring that buttons from previous events will always display the correct information associated with that specific event.
